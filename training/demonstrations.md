# Demonstrations
In this section we will walk through a few demonstrations describing how to perform various tasks using Nubis.

 - [Deploy a new application](#deploy-a-new-application)
 - [Deploy new application code](#deploy-new-application-code)
 - [Continuous Integration work-flow](#continuous-integration-work-flow)
 - [Upgrade an account](#upgrade-an-account)
 - [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

## Deploy a new application
In this demonstration we will see a full, start to finish, example of deploying a web application from scratch using Nubis.

**TODO** Create new application video

## Deploy new application code
Here we will see an example of updating code for an existing application in a sandbox account. This will be the process from updating code, rebuilding the image, through deploying the code in our sandbox environment.

## Continuous Integration work-flow
Here we will see how to promote our application code from the staging environment into the production environment. We will discover that we deployed bad code and will then see how to roll back to a working state.

## Upgrade an account
In this demonstration we will see how to update a Nubis account that is running a Nubis deployed application.

## Troubleshooting
In this demonstration we will see how to deploy a jumphost into the account. We will then log into the jumphost and then log into a web server. This is a simple demonstration to illustrate how to get into a production Nubis account for troubleshooting. We will then see how tainted resources are treated.
